# VexelCore
VexelCore is an API that's designed to be used with Bukkit derivative (i.e. Paper) and Velocity plugins so developers can write less code and offload complexity.

### üî• Why It's Awesome
- Feature management system simplifies on the fly disabling/enabling/reloading
- Reliable utilities to simplify code and speed up development
- Necessitates standards of format in configuration files for end user simplicity
- Two editions (meant for Bukkit and Velocity setups respectively) that share a common utils
- Targeted at the latest versions of Minecraft
- Developed with the community

## üïπ Ô∏èDemo Clip
Coming soon

## üìù Planned Features
- Localization//i18n system
- MySQL database manager
- And more

## ‚å®Ô∏è Developers
The following developer documentation is a WIP.

### Importing
VexelCore is currently a massive work-in-progress that is changing weekly.
Please obtain the latest Bukkit or Velocity edition and add it to your project build configuration.

Gradle example:

`compileOnly files('/home/martin/GitHub/VexelCore/bukkit/build/libs/VexelCore-Bukkit-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar')`

Note: This will change once the API is ready for an official 1.0 release.

### Note on Editions
The majority of work so far has been put into the Bukkit edition of VexelCore.

### Dependency Reminder
Don't forget to make "VexelCore" a dependency for your project's plugin platform dependency management system.
